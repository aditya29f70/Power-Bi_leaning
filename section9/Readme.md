## 1. SuperStore Report

* you will see, care fully see very ever the **font-size** is write (same) , background is given (black) 


* you can incrase the page size, first select the page (click anywhere on page) and then go to format -> canvas setting and select **type** -> custom ;; now you can provide the hight and width


* report is ready now we can publice it on online

## 2. Create an account in Power bi service
* since we want to publice this report online which we have made , we need an account first-of fall 

* in the home tab we have **publish** option ;; sign in things will come again (you should have some corporate gmail account)


* after sign in , it will give you an option that you can give invitation to other team member also 

* after that you will see a power bi service user interface

* in side bar you will see some diff options like ;; Home , Favorites, Recent, Apps, Shared with me, Workspaces, My Workspace

* so there are two options are importand for us -> WorkSpace, My Worspace

* consider workspace as a folder as in your laptop

* in workspace there is option -> Create workspace

* for currently we will learn how to publish a report from Power bi dashtop to power bi online application(server) 

## 3. Publish Report to power Bi service Account

* just click on **publish**

* so after sign-in -> it will give you option -> publish to power bi **select a destination** -> **My workspace(like folder where you can store workbooks, dashboard, datasets)**

* one team member can be assigned to diff workspaces or diff projects

* every project person might create one folder , or every department person can create on folder (HR (inside hr there may be diff folders), finance, banking etc )

* so select you workspace it will take time according to your report size --> then will publish the report on power bi service

* after publish it will show that workspace name (that would be our power bi file name)

* to open that or jump to power bi service just click on link

* you will see entire file is published (all the pages that were in you power bi file)

* and will be interective after publish(click on any report all the plot will be changed accordingly)
