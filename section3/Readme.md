## 1. creating a simple table
-> go to visualization label and choose table chart and there is only one option **values** just drag and drop those columns one by one you will see a complete it will as a table col

* if you want to arrange rows in any numberic col's assending or descending order just click on there head button


## 2. formatting a table (cosmating part like increae the size , change the background , add title etc)

## 3. Conditional Formatting in Table
* can be applied on numerical column
* so go to **cell element** in format label , now you can add background and other formating to a particular col ;; like if you apply background col -> will show dense at higher value;; lly you can apply font-color

* you can also choose **Data bars** it will give you bar in each row of that column according to that col data 

* we can also apply diff icons on a column --> if you want to control these icons there just at side there is option **Advance controls** you can modify things

## for every formating there is option just at right side called **Advance controls** so you can modify that formating

* there is also another formatting called **web url** we will see it 


## 4. Change Aggregation in Table 
* like change sum to count or avg etc
* first make a table and
* Go to at Field section (at visualization layel)

* by default the aggregation is **sum**
* if you want another col where you want to see % of profit so just take profit col again and go to Field -> Profit --> Show value as -> percent of total (or % of grand total)

## 5. Creating a Simple Matrix;
* why we need matrix -> when we want row heading and col heading
* eg; if we have all regions for each sub-category so table would be very long when we so those in 1D so matrix try to show those in 2D (row heading and col heading)


## 6. Conditional Formatting in matrix;;(go cell elements)

KPIs-> key performance indicater (those arrows ->,<-, etc)

## 7. Hierarchies (used to display more informatino in less spaces) in matrix;; 
* you can put multiple category data in row header or col head 

## 8. Subtotal and Total in matrix (go to visualization tool and explore subtotal and grande)


## 9. Number formatting in matrix and table
* click on that feature col and you will be redirected to **Column tools** where you can change the data type

* and **Field formatting** in visualization layer explore change number in K, Million etc (display unit)
