## Cards and filters are indicaters (it can be text or numbers)

## 1. Number Card (go to Card visualization option)

* it will give you **total values** like if you put sales in field option then that card will show total sales


## 2. Text Card
* eg if you put categorical feature in the field of card visualization if will show first sub-category (in the basis of alphabetical order first)

* now i want to visualize sub-category which has higher sales ;; so you can do it by filter just have to put tha sales col in the filter layer filed and select filter_type= top n and show_items= top_1 so it will fitler the that visual which you have selected and show all the things about top1 sales or highest sales ;; note after selecting a visual chart and going to apply filter you have to go **Filter on the visual**


## 3. Formatting of Text Card
* now if you want to copy formatting you just have **format painter** option in Home section just click on that card which format you want and cliek it on that diff card where you want that format

## 4. Date Card

* if you select a date in the card field it will give you **earlist date(older) in the database for that col**

* if we want to show the date at which we got hightest sales

* you can see it with the help of table but usly we don't use table for that we use card+ filter to show that 


## 5. Date Card (Relative date Filtering)
* when you drop down date col feature in the card it will give you earlist date in the date col
* what if we want to find earlist date in **last two year**

* lly we will do it by using filtering go `filters on this visual after selecting a date card -> drop down that date col again in **ADD data field here** -> you will have four option in filter type choose **relative date** -> choose **is in the last** in Show items when the value -> 2 and then choose year and apply`
