* and there is **rubber** like icon so you can use it for clear the selections

* now here is also hirarchie concept you can select multiple col data in on slicer

## 2. Formatting a text slicer

* you can just press **ctrl** and select multiple option but there might be your client know about that so you have to do something so they can select it 

* so for that you can go to format -> slicer setting -> and swtich of the single select option

* if you select before first (starting) date is gotten disable only the second box will be enable here

* if you select list you will get list of all the dates and selection box

* dropdown --> using it you can save lot of space (means one sigle option and choose all the date will come)

* relative date (imp) -> suppose if we want data only for last two years --> choose 2 in the **last option** and select year (filter on visual kind of thing)
