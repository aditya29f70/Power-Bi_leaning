## 1. Slicers for Text 

* there is only one slicer so first select it from visuelaization layer

* now drag-and-drop any text type data col in that slicer ;; you will see all the distinct category and select box option

* note if you want to select multiple option use **ctrl** and select those

* and there is **rubber** like icon so you can use it for clear the selections

* now here is also hirarchie concept you can select multiple col data in on slicer

## 2. Formatting a text slicer

* you can just press **ctrl** and select multiple option but there might be your client know about that so you have to do something so they can select it 

* so for that you can go to format -> slicer setting -> and swtich of the single select option

* currently the orientation is vertical you can change it to horigontal but there is direct silcer visualization option at the visualization layer --> choose button slicer

## 3. Date Slicers (most import slicer) -> page3

* so select slicer list
* choose any date data type -> drag-and-drop

* so you will get date in MM/dd/yy format ; and a scrolling things will come and while using it you can choose min range and max range

* right click you will see the diff kind of selection methods like (between, before, after, dropdown, relative date)

* if you select before first (starting) date is gotten disable only the second box will be enable here

* if you select list you will get list of all the dates and selection box

* dropdown --> using it you can save lot of space (means one sigle option and choose all the date will come)

* relative date (imp) -> suppose if we want data only for last two years --> choose 2 in the **last option** and select year (filter on visual kind of thing)

* not only last you can choose this , next and quater years
